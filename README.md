# Tugas Kecil 1 Strategi Algoritma

The goal of the mathematical card game "24" is to create a mathematical equation that adds up to the number 24 using all four cards. The game typically employs a deck of four cards, each with a different number, and requires players to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in order to obtain the number 24. 

The brute force approach is used in this program to solve the 24 card game. It produces all possible combinations of four integers and three mathematical operations from the input. The program then calculates every mathematical expression by trying multiple permutations of parenthesis position (5 variations) and checked if any of them equals to 24.

## Features

1. Input: The users can choose to input manually or create random input.
2. Output: Users can save the output to a txt file for future reference.
3. Timing: At the end, the program will output the elapsed time that the program used to execute (exclude users input).


## Repository Structure
1. `src` folder contains the source code (`.java` files).
2. `bin` folder contains Java bytecode (*.class) files.
3. `test` folder contains the solution of the test case (`.txt` files).
4. `doc` folder contains report of the project.
